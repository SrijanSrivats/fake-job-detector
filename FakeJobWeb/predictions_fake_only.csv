Most People hear about these technologies 9 months after the product development has launched, our engineers actually start learning about the new technologies in advance of any silicon introductions. In most cases, we are an early partner to silicon vendors and help guide the silicon features. This is extremely rare for many of the new members, once they do the first project they want more and more. As you can imagine the value of that engineer is much greater then when they walked in the door."" ""Most engineers that I interview have been disappointed by their employers, and when asked how much ownership they have of the product they developed, the answer is always something like : I only did this this portion of the software, or some portion of the chip, or some portion of the hardware. Not much of an empowerment here.  Here, the PE is the complete owner of every molecule of the product, including mechanical, operation, finance, cost, etc. This empowerment is another added value boost an engineer could benefit from, this value is rare and will push the engineer in the direction of someday running a business end to end with a larger responsibility and scope. The more of these projects they take the faster they reach that level of career growth and maturity."" This is what not shared on the JD. ""How you will mature your career."" Job Responsibilities: • For assigned projects, take overall responsibility for delivering the product to production; including requirements generation, hardware, firmware, documentation, regulatory testing and Agile release requirements, per Netgear policies.

They ask others their opinion and really listen to the answer. They know they might be wrong and admit it when they actually are. Heck, they're just plain pleasant to be around.  In short, they're ""confidently humble"". Do you like working with people like that too? Are you one of those people?  Read on...Important:This is a remote position with a fully remote company, meaning you can be located anywhere.About Us:We’re a profitable, bootstrapped, growing company. We create beautiful, effective personal finance software that’s changing how people think about their money.  Our software is named “You Need a Budget”, but everyone just calls it “YNAB”.  For years now, lots of people have been buying YNAB and then telling their friends how awesome it is.  (Google us and you’ll see.)  We’ve got desktop, iPhone, and Android apps, and we’re currently working on an iPad App.Now we want a Web AppOur desktop software is great, but our customers would love to access YNAB on the web too. We’re already hard at work on our Rails-based API that will take care of the difficult stuff like syncing data between our various clients. So, much of the back end is covered. Now we want to write a Javascript app that does everything client-side, and only uses the API to send the data back and forth. That architecture would have a lot of benefits, like allowing us to wrap it and deploy it on the desktop, or letting folks use the app even when they’re offline.And that’s where you come in!You’ve got significant experience architecting and building large, Javascript-centric web apps, and you’d like to work with us on a full time (40 hours/week) basis. If you’re international, your status would be as an independent contractor. If you’re stateside, you can be W2, or independent contractor as well. It’d be your call.This app is going to be our bread and butter. You will be helping us lay the foundation for our web and desktop efforts for years to come.  After reading that, you’re hopefully thinking, “Wow! Cool!” And then, if you’re really experienced, you’re probably thinking, “Oh, wow...that sounds like a lot of responsibility!” And you’d be right. But now you’re probably already back to thinking how much fun this is going to be...We’re using Ember as our framework and have been very happy with it so far.

Our ideal candidate now lives and breathes web tech, but perhaps had a former life in another language.Know more languages than just Javascript/Coffeescript.Have experience with at least one of the major modern Javascript frameworks other than JQuery: Ember, Backbone, AngularJS, Dojo, Sproutcore, YUI, etc,Are suitably paranoid about security.Are familiar with distributed version control like Git or MercurialHave excellent debugging skillsHave great architecture software design skills. Many of us will be learning about Javascript architecture by reading your code, so it should smell great.Understand the balance between shipping regularly and getting things rightHave excellent spoken and written English (we’re an international team, so accents are fine!)  Know how to use in-browser developer tools to great effectSpeak fluent CSS and/or one of its precompiled variants (SASS, LESS, Stylus, etc)Are at home on the command lineUse descriptive variable namesLike to optimize/profileWrite code that is easy for other programmers to understand and useGeek out about automation, continuous integration, and continuous deployment.Understand the value of a strong test suiteDislike reinventing the wheel and consequently enjoy finding a library that does *just* what you were about to code yourself.You’re self motivated and thrive with directions like:  “We’re thinking of writing a shared Javascript library that we’ll use on all of our platforms, but we’re concerned about performance on mobile. How should we go about investigating?” or ""This is our first Javascript app, so we aren’t sure what the current state of the art tools are for building, minifying, concatenating, etc. Can you get a build/test system set up so that the other devs can hit the ground running on Mac and Windows?”You get Bonus Points if:You live anywhere remotely close to Texas, Switzerland, Maryland, or Italy.

"We need 25 Agents growing company-See below","We have the demand. We are looking for people that are quick learners, and are very efficient, to handle the demand. We have the best mortgage protection program in the business, and we have serious demand nationwide; especially in the 703/202/301 area. After all, we are in a market where 95% of all Americans, if they added up all the insurances that they hold, would not have enough to cover their mortgage. Can you imagine a product that everybody NEEDS (not just wants), and all you have to do is meet with people that have already requested our service. No Cold Calling or Door Knocking! We are looking for someone that is very professional and is able to learn quickly, because you can't make six figures in a year by moving slowly. We will train you in every aspect of the business, and will show you how to personally produce a monthly commission of at least 7,000-10,000. We have the tools, and we are looking to bring on someone that we can groom into management. You will learn this business, and eventually we plan to teach you how to build a strong staff, that you will train to move product the same way that you do. This combination should easily push you into a yearly compensation of 150k+ within your first 3 years in the business if you move at a steady pace. Industry experience is not necessary, but a track record of success is. Our company mails out over 1.5 million letters each week and our homeowners fill out a questionnaire and mail back the request for coverage to us. We simply call that exclusive lead and set up an appointment with them. We meet the customer in their home and go over what type of mortgage protection the homeowner needs and then write up the policy. We also market and promote fixed indexed annuities that solve most of the baby boomers retirement issues. We have many full time agents making over 6 and 7 figure incomes! We are primarily looking for those that desire to move into management, though, if you are looking for part time or full time warm sales, please send your resume as well. We have a serious demand all over the 703/202/301 area that consistently outweighs our number of agents. Typically our employees make 30k+ part time, 75-100k full time, 100k+ Management. Though, we design a specific plan to make sure you hit whatever compensation YOU seriously desire, and are willing to work for. What we are looking for: * A passion to honestly help families. * Positive attitude with a strong desire to become wealthy. * A person who can follow a step by step selling system. What we are not looking for: *Someone who isn't accountable to their word. *Someone who says they are a great salesman, but doesn't have a penny to their name. *Someone who has had a recent foreclosure or bankruptcy (you can't get licensed in those cases) We need you and you need us.

"Part Time Opportunity for Professionals","We have the demand. We are looking for people that are quick learners, and are very efficient, to handle the demand. We have the best mortgage protection program in the business, and we have serious demand nationwide; especially in the 703/202/301 area. After all, we are in a market where 95% of all Americans, if they added up all the insurances that they hold, would not have enough to cover their mortgage. Can you imagine a product that everybody NEEDS (not just wants), and all you have to do is meet with people that have already requested our service. No Cold Calling or Door Knocking! We are looking for someone that is very professional and is able to learn quickly, because you can't make six figures in a year by moving slowly. We will train you in every aspect of the business, and will show you how to personally produce a monthly commission of at least 7,000-10,000. We have the tools, and we are looking to bring on someone that we can groom into management. You will learn this business, and eventually we plan to teach you how to build a strong staff, that you will train to move product the same way that you do. This combination should easily push you into a yearly compensation of 150k+ within your first 3 years in the business if you move at a steady pace. Industry experience is not necessary, but a track record of success is. Our company mails out over 1.5 million letters each week and our homeowners fill out a questionnaire and mail back the request for coverage to us. We simply call that exclusive lead and set up an appointment with them. We meet the customer in their home and go over what type of mortgage protection the homeowner needs and then write up the policy. We also market and promote fixed indexed annuities that solve most of the baby boomers retirement issues. We have many full time agents making over 6 and 7 figure incomes! We are primarily looking for those that desire to move into management, though, if you are looking for part time or full time warm sales, please send your resume as well. We have a serious demand all over the 703/202/301 area that consistently outweighs our number of agents. Typically our employees make 30k+ part time, 75-100k full time, 100k+ Management. Though, we design a specific plan to make sure you hit whatever compensation YOU seriously desire, and are willing to work for. What we are looking for: * A passion to honestly help families. * Positive attitude with a strong desire to become wealthy. * A person who can follow a step by step selling system. What we are not looking for: *Someone who isn't accountable to their word. *Someone who says they are a great salesman, but doesn't have a penny to their name. *Someone who has had a recent foreclosure or bankruptcy (you can't get licensed in those cases) We need you and you need us.

"Looking for go getters that want to receive weekly P/T pay","We have the demand. We are looking for people that are quick learners, and are very efficient, to handle the demand. We have the best mortgage protection program in the business, and we have serious demand nationwide; especially in the 703/202/301 area. After all, we are in a market where 95% of all Americans, if they added up all the insurances that they hold, would not have enough to cover their mortgage. Can you imagine a product that everybody NEEDS (not just wants), and all you have to do is meet with people that have already requested our service. No Cold Calling or Door Knocking! We are looking for someone that is very professional and is able to learn quickly, because you can't make six figures in a year by moving slowly. We will train you in every aspect of the business, and will show you how to personally produce a monthly commission of at least 7,000-10,000. We have the tools, and we are looking to bring on someone that we can groom into management. You will learn this business, and eventually we plan to teach you how to build a strong staff, that you will train to move product the same way that you do. This combination should easily push you into a yearly compensation of 150k+ within your first 3 years in the business if you move at a steady pace. Industry experience is not necessary, but a track record of success is. Our company mails out over 1.5 million letters each week and our homeowners fill out a questionnaire and mail back the request for coverage to us. We simply call that exclusive lead and set up an appointment with them. We meet the customer in their home and go over what type of mortgage protection the homeowner needs and then write up the policy. We also market and promote fixed indexed annuities that solve most of the baby boomers retirement issues. We have many full time agents making over 6 and 7 figure incomes! We are primarily looking for those that desire to move into management, though, if you are looking for part time or full time warm sales, please send your resume as well. We have a serious demand all over the 703/202/301 area that consistently outweighs our number of agents. Typically our employees make 30k+ part time, 75-100k full time, 100k+ Management. Though, we design a specific plan to make sure you hit whatever compensation YOU seriously desire, and are willing to work for. What we are looking for: * A passion to honestly help families. * Positive attitude with a strong desire to become wealthy. * A person who can follow a step by step selling system. What we are not looking for: *Someone who isn't accountable to their word. *Someone who says they are a great salesman, but doesn't have a penny to their name. *Someone who has had a recent foreclosure or bankruptcy (you can't get licensed in those cases) We need you and you need us.

"Senior Engineering Product Manager","Senior Engineering Product ManagerAs a member of the Service Provider Engineering team, you will be responsible for managing the development of broadband DSL products targeted at service providers that provide Home Gateway, voice gateways, wireless adapters, IPTV and Voice over IP (VoIP) services. These products will incorporate one or several of the following technologies: DSL, Routers, 802.11 Wireless, VPN, Firewalls.  The primary function of an engineering product manager is project management and technical oversight. The individual manages the ODM to ensure that products are delivered in a timely fashion to a high quality and in accordance with the procedures and systems. In addition the individual oversees the activities between the component vendors and the ODM. Within the service provider group, another important project management aspect is working with the sales engineers to get products approved at service providers. The individual must manage the technical issues that arise during the approval process and ensure a rapid resolution by working with and through the sales engineers, ODMs and Component vendors. A word from the Recruiter: ""Some of the exciting things that retain engineers here are the new technologies that we integrate into our products. Most People hear about these technologies 9 months after the product development has launched, our engineers actually start learning about the new technologies in advance of any silicon introductions. In most cases, we are an early partner to silicon vendors and help guide the silicon features. This is extremely rare for many of the new members, once they do the first project they want more and more. As you can imagine the value of that engineer is much greater then when they walked in the door."" ""Most engineers that I interview have been disappointed by their employers, and when asked how much ownership they have of the product they developed, the answer is always something like : I only did this this portion of the software, or some portion of the chip, or some portion of the hardware. Not much of an empowerment here.  Here, the PE is the complete owner of every molecule of the product, including mechanical, operation, finance, cost, etc. This empowerment is another added value boost an engineer could benefit from, this value is rare and will push the engineer in the direction of someday running a business end to end with a larger responsibility and scope. The more of these projects they take the faster they reach that level of career growth and maturity."" This is what not shared on the JD. ""How you will mature your career."" Job Responsibilities: • For assigned projects, take overall responsibility for delivering the product to production; including requirements generation, hardware, firmware, documentation, regulatory testing and Agile release requirements, per Netgear policies.

"Full Stack Developer (Mid Level)","What we are doing:Talent Standard is bringing adaptive learning to corporate training resulting in faster and more effective learning for everyone. Our first product is applying adaptive learning to complex financial model training and targets teams in banking and finance. Long term we are helping companies adapt to a world where brilliant people don’t need credentials. We enable brilliant people, regardless of their background, by delivering relevant high quality knowledge connected to the challenges they are facing.How adaptive learning works:Adaptive learning works by clustering experience data to (1) develop knowledge curves (e.g. beginning vs. advanced) and (2) determine the strength of relationships between concepts (e.g. to know ‘B’ you have to know ‘A’ first). Using this analysis we are able to very effectively assess what a person does not know and present personalized training to fill in those gaps.Who we are:At our core we are scientists learning about people and knowledge through observation in order to add value to the lives of others. We are democratizing business knowledge because our hypothesis is that given the necessary knowledge and skill, a person’s potential is unlimited. Proving this hypothesis requires remarkable results.To achieve remarkable results we think big, but build simple. Our incremental goals are big enough to matter, but small enough to achieve. Changing the world doesn't happen overnight, and we are in this for the long haul. There will be challenges, and we transparently embrace them with grit and resilience.

"Part time Agents wanted","We have the demand. We are looking for people that are quick learners, and are very efficient, to handle the demand. We have the best mortgage protection program in the business, and we have serious demand nationwide; especially in the 703/202/301 area. After all, we are in a market where 95% of all Americans, if they added up all the insurances that they hold, would not have enough to cover their mortgage. Can you imagine a product that everybody NEEDS (not just wants), and all you have to do is meet with people that have already requested our service. No Cold Calling or Door Knocking! We are looking for someone that is very professional and is able to learn quickly, because you can't make six figures in a year by moving slowly. We will train you in every aspect of the business, and will show you how to personally produce a monthly commission of at least 7,000-10,000. We have the tools, and we are looking to bring on someone that we can groom into management. You will learn this business, and eventually we plan to teach you how to build a strong staff, that you will train to move product the same way that you do. This combination should easily push you into a yearly compensation of 150k+ within your first 3 years in the business if you move at a steady pace. Industry experience is not necessary, but a track record of success is. Our company mails out over 1.5 million letters each week and our homeowners fill out a questionnaire and mail back the request for coverage to us. We simply call that exclusive lead and set up an appointment with them. We meet the customer in their home and go over what type of mortgage protection the homeowner needs and then write up the policy. We also market and promote fixed indexed annuities that solve most of the baby boomers retirement issues. We have many full time agents making over 6 and 7 figure incomes! We are primarily looking for those that desire to move into management, though, if you are looking for part time or full time warm sales, please send your resume as well. We have a serious demand all over the 703/202/301 area that consistently outweighs our number of agents. Typically our employees make 30k+ part time, 75-100k full time, 100k+ Management. Though, we design a specific plan to make sure you hit whatever compensation YOU seriously desire, and are willing to work for. What we are looking for: * A passion to honestly help families. * Positive attitude with a strong desire to become wealthy. * A person who can follow a step by step selling system. What we are not looking for: *Someone who isn't accountable to their word. *Someone who says they are a great salesman, but doesn't have a penny to their name. *Someone who has had a recent foreclosure or bankruptcy (you can't get licensed in those cases) We need you and you need us. Contact us with your resume (preferred), or call the Hiring Manager  with your information for possible interview.•    Compensation: 30k+ part time, 75-100k full time, 100k+ Management","","","",0,0,0,"Yes",0.9818,0.0182

We have the best mortgage protection program in the business, and we have serious demand nationwide; especially in the 703/202/301 area. After all, we are in a market where 95% of all Americans, if they added up all the insurances that they hold, would not have enough to cover their mortgage. Can you imagine a product that everybody NEEDS (not just wants), and all you have to do is meet with people that have already requested our service. No Cold Calling or Door Knocking! We are looking for someone that is very professional and is able to learn quickly, because you can't make six figures in a year by moving slowly. We will train you in every aspect of the business, and will show you how to personally produce a monthly commission of at least 7,000-10,000. We have the tools, and we are looking to bring on someone that we can groom into management. You will learn this business, and eventually we plan to teach you how to build a strong staff, that you will train to move product the same way that you do. This combination should easily push you into a yearly compensation of 150k+ within your first 3 years in the business if you move at a steady pace. Industry experience is not necessary, but a track record of success is. Our company mails out over 1.5 million letters each week and our homeowners fill out a questionnaire and mail back the request for coverage to us. We simply call that exclusive lead and set up an appointment with them. We meet the customer in their home and go over what type of mortgage protection the homeowner needs and then write up the policy. We also market and promote fixed indexed annuities that solve most of the baby boomers retirement issues. We have many full time agents making over 6 and 7 figure incomes! We are primarily looking for those that desire to move into management, though, if you are looking for part time or full time warm sales, please send your resume as well. We have a serious demand all over the 703/202/301 area that consistently outweighs our number of agents. Typically our employees make 30k+ part time, 75-100k full time, 100k+ Management. Though, we design a specific plan to make sure you hit whatever compensation YOU seriously desire, and are willing to work for. What we are looking for: * A passion to honestly help families. * Positive attitude with a strong desire to become wealthy. * A person who can follow a step by step selling system. What we are not looking for: *Someone who isn't accountable to their word. *Someone who says they are a great salesman, but doesn't have a penny to their name. *Someone who has had a recent foreclosure or bankruptcy (you can't get licensed in those cases) We need you and you need us.
